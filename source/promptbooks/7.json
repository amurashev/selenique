  "why": "Professional maternity photography shoots cost $800–$2,500+ per session. Add maternity wardrobe styling ($300–$800), professional hair and makeup ($200–$500), location scouting and fees ($200–$800), lighting equipment, props, and professional editing ($150–$400 per image)—you're easily investing $2,000–$4,000+ for a comprehensive maternity photo collection.And maternity is time-sensitive. Your pregnancy window is finite. If you miss the perfect timing, you can't recreate it. Professional shoots can be booked months in advance, leaving expectant mothers stressed about timing and availability.But what if you could generate stunning, professional-quality maternity photos whenever you want—instantly, for a fraction of the cost, with complete creative control? ✨"
