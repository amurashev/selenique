  "why": "Professional product photography costs $500–$2,000+ per session. Add studio rental ($200–$500), professional lighting equipment ($300–$1,000), backdrop and set design ($200–$600), product styling and props ($150–$400), professional retouching ($100–$300 per image), and multiple angle variations—you're easily investing $2,000–$4,500+ for a comprehensive cosmetic product collection.And that's just for one product line. Launch a new skincare line? Introduce seasonal collections? Update your branding? You're back to investing thousands—or months waiting for new professional shoots to align with your product launch timeline.But what if you could generate stunning, professional-grade cosmetic product photos whenever you need them—instantly, for a fraction of the cost, with complete creative control? ✨"
