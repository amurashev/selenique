  "description": "This comprehensive Prompt Book contains 40 meticulously engineered AI prompts specifically designed to generate authentic, boardroom-ready business headshots for Muslim women that project confidence, cultural pride, and professional authority.",
  "why": "Muslim women entrepreneurs face a unique challenge: most professional stock photos either don't represent cultural identity, or professional photography services lack understanding of hijab styling, cultural preferences, and the specific aesthetic needs of Muslim business leaders. Generic corporate photography ignores your identity. Hiring photographers who understand your culture? That costs $800–$2,000+ per session.But what if you could generate professional, culturally authentic business headshots whenever you need them—instantly, for a fraction of the cost, with complete creative control? ✨"
